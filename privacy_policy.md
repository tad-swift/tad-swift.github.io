## Privacy Policy

Privacy has always been an integral part of Foodie Thing. The developers
of Foodie Thing strive to keep the users secure and private. Therefore,
we established the following principles:

* We are thoughtful about what personal information we collect.
* We do not keep your personal information if it's not essential.
* We do our best to keep your personal information private and secure.
* We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your
personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these
principles.

### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

The developers and maintainers behind the Foodie Thing app and website
are a couple of college students.  This Privacy Policy applies to information 
that we collect about you when you use:

* Our mobile applications;
* Our website ([foodiething.com](https://foodiething.com))

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our mobile applications
and websites collectively as “Services.” Please note that this Privacy
Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a
separate privacy policy. Below we explain how we collect, use, and
share information about you, along with the choices that you have
with respect to that information.

### Creative Commons Sharealike License

We established this policy based on [Automattic's Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic/blob/master/Privacy-Policy.md).
Thus this document is licensed under the [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so.
Let’s go over the information that we collect.

* **Log Information**: Like most online service providers, we collect
information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically
make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device
identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of
access, operating system, and mobile network information. Keep in
mind that we do not upload the logs generated locally from your
devices onto our servers.
* **Usage Information**: We collect information about your usage of
our Services. For example, we collect information about the session
count and demographic distributions of where our app is installed, as 
well as to see which features our users use the most. We use this
information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as
get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our
Services better.

### How and Why We Use Information

#### Purposes for Using Information

We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes
listed below:

* To provide our Services;
* To further develop and improve our Services;
* To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact
with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them
easier to use;
* To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the
security of our Services.
* To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content
recommendations.

#### Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for
processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is
that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use
is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable
terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer
your account; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal
obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests
or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your
information -- for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve
our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to
safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and
improve the effectiveness of our advertising; to understand our user
retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our
Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your
consent--for example before we place certain cookies on your device and
access and analyze them later on.

### Sharing Information

#### How We Share Information

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information
about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with
appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

* **Third Party Vendors**: We may share information about you with third
party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide
their services to us, or to provide their services to you from within the app.
This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like the
listing websites we use to provide detailed information for an anime), those
that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). 
These vendors are: Google, Apple.
* **Legal and Regulatory Requirements**: We may disclose information
about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental
request.
* **To Protect Rights, Property, and Others**: We may disclose information
about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
necessary to protect the property or rights of the developers, third parties,
or the public at large.
* **With Your Consent**: We may share and disclose information with your
consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information
with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the
anime tracking services that you connected our Services to.
* **Aggregated or De-Identified Information**: We may share information
that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the
information could not reasonably be used to identify you.
* **Published Support Requests**: And if you send us a request (for
example, via a Discord or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to
your request or to help us support other users.

#### Information NOT Shared Publicly

Your information is not public information. We want to keep our user's data private.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the
information for the purposes for which we collect and use it--which are
described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information--and
we are not legally required to continue to keep it. 

For example, we keep the server logs that record information about the
usage of our Services, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and
operating system, for approximately 30 days.

We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things,
analyze traffic to our Services and investigate issues if something goes
wrong on one of our Services.

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect
information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring
our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

### How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer:

### Privacy Policy Changes

We may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you
to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below,
and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a
statement to our mobile application, or sending you a notification through
email). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy
Policy will be subject to the updated policy. That’s it! Thanks for reading.

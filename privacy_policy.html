<ul>
<li><strong>Log Information</strong>: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. Keep in mind that we do not upload the logs generated locally from your devices onto our servers.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Information</strong>: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the session count and demographic distributions of where our app is installed, as well as to see which features our users use the most. We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sharing-information">Sharing Information</h3>
<h4 id="how-we-share-information">How We Share Information</h4>
<p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Party Vendors</strong>: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you from within the app. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like the listing websites we use to provide detailed information for an anime), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). These vendors are: Google, Apple.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
<li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others</strong>: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the developers, third parties, or the public at large.</li>
<li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the anime tracking services that you connected our Services to.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information</strong>: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.</li>
<li><strong>Published Support Requests</strong>: And if you send us a request (for example, via a Discord or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-not-shared-publicly">Information NOT Shared Publicly</h4>
<p>Your information is not public information. We want to keep our user's data private.</p>

<p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it--which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information--and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>
<p>For example, we keep the server logs that record information about the usage of our Services, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days.</p>
<p>We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to our Services and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our Services.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
